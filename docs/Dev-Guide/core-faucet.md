:::caution
Each address can request **only one tCORE or tCORE2 per day** from the faucet within a 24-hour period. If you've run out of tCORE or tCORE2 and the faucet won't send you more because of the daily limit of one tCORE or tCORE2, come back after 24 hours and try again. Alternatively, you can request it in Core's Discord Server.

:::note
tCORE and tCORE2 are only used for testing and do not have any value. Do not use it for real financial transactions.
