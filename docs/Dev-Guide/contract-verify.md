# Contract Verification

---

To promote transparency, it is considered best practice to verify all deployed contracts on the Core blockchain. While there are several ways to achieve contract verification, we recommend using Core's official verification tool, [Core Scan](https://scan.coredao.org/), for optimal reliability. This document guides you through the most commonly used methods for contract verification: the Core Scan web tool, the Core REST API, and the Hardhat Verification plugin.

:::note
Ensure that your smart contract complies with the [Solidity Support Guidelines by Core](./smart-contract-guidelines.md). To meet these guidelines, set the `evmVersion` parameter to `paris` within the Solidity compiler settings.

## Web Verification via Core Scan

Web verification is the most commonly used smart contract verification strategy. After deploying your smart contract onto Core blockchain, you can use its source code to verify it on the Core Scan.

1. Navigate to Core Scan website.

- [For Core Mainnet](https://scan.coredao.org/)
- [For Core Testnet2](https://scan.test.btcs.network)
- [For Core Legacy Testnet](https://scan.test.btcs.network)

2. Search for the contract by address on Core Scan. Simply paste the contract address in the search bar on the website.
3. After locating the contract, select the **Contract** tab and click **Verify and Publish**_._

<p align="center">
![verify-core-scan](../../static/img/contract-verification/contract-verify-1.avif)
</p>

4\. Fill in the required verification information on the page, specifically:

- Contract address;
- Compiler type: for simple contracts, select the `Single File` compiler type. For more complex contracts, such as contracts with external imports, select the `Standard Json` compiler type;
- Compiler version;
- Open-source license type;

<p align="center">
![verify-core-scan](../../static/img/contract-verification/contract-verify-2.avif)
</p>

5\. On the next page, fill in the contract's Solidity source code.

If your contract has constructor parameters, it is recommended to specify them in the `Constructor Arguments` field, although it’s not mandatory. The constructor parameters should be formatted as ABI-encoded bytes. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and other tools can generate these for you.

If you enabled optimization during contract compilation, select "Yes" for the `Optimization` field.

<p align="center">
![verify-contract](../../static/img/contract-verification/contract-verify-3.avif)
</p>

6\. Click on **Verify and Publish** to finish the process.

<p align="center">
![verify-contract](../../static/img/contract-verification/contract-verify-4.avif)
</p>

Now your verified contract on Core Scan should look like this:

![verify-contract](../../static/img/contract-verification/contract-verify-5.avif)
</p>

## Core REST API Verification

You can find the guide to using the Core API to verify contracts [here](https://docs.coredao.org/docs/api/api-documents/contracts). Please note that to make API calls you must register on Core Scan and generate an API key.

If you're familiar with the Etherscan API, you're in luck! The API calls on Core are 100% compatible with the Etherscan API. You just need to replace the API key and endpoint URL and everything should work properly.

## HardHat Verification

HardHat verification is the most convenient way for developers to verify smart contracts. For more information on Hardhat verification, refer to the official Hardhat verification guide located [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify).

Please note that you’ll need to add Core networks as custom chains, as seen below in a sample HardHat config:

```javascript
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */

const { PrivateKey } = require("./secret.json");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify");

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "testnet",

  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    testnet: {
      url: "https://rpc.test2.btcs.network",
      accounts: [PrivateKey],
      chainId: 1114,
    },
    mainnet: {
      url: "https://rpc.coredao.org",
      accounts: [PrivateKey],
      chainId: 1116,
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      testnet: "api key",
      mainnet: "api key",
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "testnet",
        chainId: 1114,
        urls: {
          apiURL: "https://api.test2.btcs.network/api",
          browserURL: "https://scan.test2.btcs.network/",
        },
      },
      {
        network: "mainnet",
        chainId: 1116,
        urls: {
          apiURL: "https://openapi.coredao.org/api",
          browserURL: "https://scan.coredao.org/",
        },
      },
    ],
  },

  solidity: {
    compilers: [
      {
        version: "0.8.24",
        settings: {
          evmVersion: "shanghai",
          optimizer: {
            enabled: false,
            runs: 200,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  paths: {
    sources: "./contracts",
    cache: "./cache",
    artifacts: "./artifacts",
  },
  mocha: {
    timeout: 20000,
  },
};
```

## Foundry Verification

update the `foundry.toml` file to specify the Solidity version and EVM version for your project.

```bash
[profile.default]
solidity_version = "0.8.0"  # Specify the Solidity version
evm_version = "shanghai" #Specify the EVM version (For older testnet, use Paris as EVM version)
```

create a `.env` file to store sensitive information such as your private key, RPC URL, and API keys. This helps to keep your credentials secure and allows you to easily reference them in your code.

```text
RPC_URL = " https://rpc.test2.btcs.network"
PRIVATE_KEY = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
CORESCAN_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
API_URL="https://api.test2.btcs.network/api"
```

**Important:** Never commit this `.env` file to version control (e.g., GitHub) to prevent exposing your sensitive information. If you're using git, add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore`.

Now that you've created the above `.env` file, run the following command to load the environment variables in the current command line session:

```bash
source .env
```

Execute the below command to verify your smart contract

```bash
forge verify-contract 0xContract_Address ContractName  --verifier-url $API_URL  --api-key $CORESCAN_API_KEY --watch
```

Replace `0xContract_Address` and `ContractName` with your actual contract address and the contract Name.

Foundry will handle the verification process,you can use[ Core Scan](https://scan.test2.btcs.network/) to search for the contract's address to verify that the contract was successfully deployed and verified.

## Known Limitations

- Currently Core only supports solidity compiler versions up to 0.8.24.
- Libraries are not supported using API verifications.
- If you run into issues verifying very large (1000+ lines) single file contracts, we recommend switching to `Standard JSON` format for verification.
