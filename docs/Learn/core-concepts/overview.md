# Overview of the Core Blockchain
---


## Introduction

Core is a high-performance, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, designed to be Bitcoin's complementary and hyper-scalable smart contract platform. By leveraging Bitcoin-native CLTV timelocks, Bitcoin mining hash power, and modern smart contract capabilities, Core unlocks Bitcoin as both the prime protector and central asset of a thriving decentralized application ecosystem.


## Purpose and Mission

The Core blockchain exists to unlock both the Bitcoin network and Bitcoin as an asset, creating a scalable, permissionless smart contract platform that empowers Bitcoin-focused finance while leveraging Bitcoin's decentralized security and immense value.

Bitcoin alignment is central to this mission because Bitcoin itself serves as the ultimate incentive aligner. While the Bitcoin blockchain securely preserves the Bitcoin asset by aligning stakeholder incentives, its design necessarily limits speed, scalability, and flexibility. Rather than modifying Bitcoin's base layer, Core extends this alignment through its Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism.

Bitcoin's Nakamoto Consensus and Core's Satoshi Plus consensus mutually reinforce each other, simultaneously protecting both the Bitcoin asset and Bitcoin-powered smart contracts. This synergy unlocks multiple benefits: a trustless yield for Bitcoin holders, supplemental rewards for Bitcoin miners, and a growing Bitcoin-powered financial ecosystem that serves both Bitcoin and DeFi users.

## Core Technology

1. **Satoshi Plus Consensus:** This innovative consensus mechanism combines Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, thereby incorporating Bitcoin miners, CORE stakers, and Bitcoin stakers, respectively, in the election of Core validators. Each of these three legs of Satoshi Plus introduces a new layer of security and incentive alignment.  
   * **Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW):** Bitcoin miners enhance Core's security by delegating their hash power to Core validators and, in exchange, earn supplemental rewards in the form of CORE tokens. This symbiotic relationship leverages Bitcoin's robust security infrastructure without additional costs to the miners, aligning incentives and bolstering network integrity.  
   * **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Holders of CORE tokens actively participate in Core's consensus by delegating their tokens to validators as part of the validator election process. In exchange for electing healthy validators, CORE stakers earn CORE token rewards. 
   * **Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking:** Bitcoin holders can participate in Core's validator election in exchange for timelocking their Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network using Bitcoin's native CLTV function. In exchange for electing healthy validators, Bitcoin stakers earn CORE token rewards.
2. **Advanced Smart Contract Capabilities:** Core functions as a fully EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain, providing developers with a familiar environment to build and deploy applications. This compatibility allows for seamless porting of existing Ethereum-based dApps to Core with minimal modifications, accelerating ecosystem growth while leveraging established development tools, libraries, and best practices.
3. **Security Enhancements**  
   * **Enhanced Transaction Validation**: Core involves Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin stakers in the security of its smart contracts.  
   * **Guardian Nodes:** In addition to existing security checks, Verifiers are responsible for monitoring the network for any signs of malicious activity and can penalize bad actors with verifiable proof.  
4. **Interoperability Features**  
   * **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** As a scalable, EVM-compatible blockchain, Core has integrations with many cross-chain dApps and bridges.  
   * **Core Bridge:** Powered by Layer Zero, the Core Bridge facilitates effortless asset transfers between Core and other blockchains.  
   * **lstBTC *(Upcoming)*:** is a liquid, yield-bearing Bitcoin token issued on the Core blockchain, enabling Bitcoin holders—especially institutional investors—to earn BTC-denominated yield while maintaining existing custodial arrangements and full asset liquidity.  
5. **Usability and Accessibility**  
   * **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Products on Core are easily accessible through several user-friendly and commonly used wallets and interfaces.
   * **Comprehensive Developer Tools:** Core supports an extensive suite of tools to help developers build, deploy, and manage applications on Core.  
6. **Governance and Community Engagement**  
   * **On-Chain Governance**: The Core blockchain also features an on-chain governance process. Key decisions, like changes to variable on-chain parameters, adjustments to rewards and burn mechanism, etc., are made through community participation and on-chain voting, giving users a direct say in the platform’s development.  

## State of the Core Ecosystem

Core hosts a thriving BTCfi ecosystem that unlocks Bitcoin and its derivatives for DeFi applications. While Bitcoin's limited programmability has traditionally left it underutilized in DeFi, Core provides an environment where protocols can leverage Bitcoin-based assets effectively. Multiple builder support programs like [Core Wishlist](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-community-contributions/blob/main/Core-Wishlist.md), [Core Ignition](https://ignition.coredao.org/), [Core Ignition Builders' Incentive Program](https://coredao.org/initiatives/incentiveprogram), [Core Starter Program](https://coredao.org/initiatives/corestarterprogram), and [Core Commit Program](https://coredao.org/initiatives/commit-program) are intended to support and incentivize building innovative projects on Core and catalyze more growth around Bitcoin DeFi.

## Future Vision

The Core roadmap is designed in accordance with the primary goal of unlocking Bitcoin. This includes many structural upgrades designed to further align Bitcoin and Core, creating a better user experience for users and leveraging other areas of research and development. Ultimately, these items serve to make a more interconnected and functionally diverse blockchain ecosystem where Bitcoin's foundational strengths are leveraged to support new and emerging technologies and applications in DeFi. Some roadmap items include:

* **lstBTC:** This liquid staking feature would allow Bitcoin stakers to earn yield on their asset while preserving the liquidity to participate in the DeFi landscape of Core and supported networks.  
* **Local Fee Markets:** Improvements that can make transactions more predictable and cost-effective. 
* **Core Atomic Swaps:** Leveraging HTLCs, Core Atomic Swaps will enable the trustless, peer-to-peer exchange of tokens between Core and other blockchains, including (and especially) Bitcoin.  
* **Restaking:** This addition would enable other protocols to benefit from Core's Bitcoin protection.

## Conclusion

Core maximizes Bitcoin's utility while building a thriving Bitcoin-powered financial ecosystem through its unique Satoshi Plus consensus. By bringing together Bitcoin miners, CORE holders, and Bitcoin holders, Core creates a secure, decentralized platform where Bitcoin's fundamental strengths are enhanced, not compromised. This approach opens new possibilities for everyone in the ecosystem while cementing Bitcoin's role as the cornerstone of an open, permissionless digital economy.
