# Architecture of the Core Blockchain

---

Core's architecture is built around **Satoshi Plus**, a tripartite consensus mechanism that integrates **Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW), Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**.

Through Satoshi Plus, **Bitcoin miners/mining pools, Bitcoin stakers, and CORE token stakers** delegate resources to elect validators who secure the Core network. Validator selection is based on a hybrid score, considering:

- **Delegated hash power** from Bitcoin miners/mining pools
- **Delegated/staked Bitcoin** from Bitcoin holders
- **Delegated/staked CORE tokens** from CORE token holders
